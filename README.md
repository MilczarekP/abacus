# abacus
abacus for numbers of arbitrary length

This program acts as a digital abacus. It performs calculations such as addition, substraction, multiplication and division, both for positive and negative integers.
Like an abacus it is only able to work with integers.
It is an abacus of arbitrary length, meaning that the integers can be as long as one wants.

Furthermore, this abacus is capable of operating in any base (subject to limitations), and can convert from one base to another.
